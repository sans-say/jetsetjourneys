            </figure>

   

             <p>Travel to the Turks and Caicos Islands to see some of the most

                beautiful white sand beaches in the Caribbean, including Grace Bay.

                Home to one of the largest barrier reef systems in the world, this

                collection of coral islands also offers unforgettable experiences for

                snorkelers and scuba divers. Whether you choose to spend the bulk of

                your time on land or underwater, these islands make a wonderful

                retreat for those seeking maximum comfort in a tropical setting.

                However, hotel prices can be higher here than in other Caribbean

                locales, especially during the peak winter season.

            <h2>St. Lucia</h2>

                    <img src="cb3.jpg" width="600" height="600" border="2">

                </center>

            </figure>

            <p>Visit St. Lucia for its sprawling chalk-colored beaches, towering

                volcanic peaks and upscale resorts. You can start your day with a

                hiking adventure through the Pitons, soak up some midday sun along

                Reduit Beach and watch the sun set over the Caribbean Sea. You'll

                want to also save time for a visit to Sulphur Springs, the world's

                only drive-in volcano. St. Lucia's plethora of romantic luxury hotels,

                 most of which offer incredible views of the Pitons, makes this

                 Caribbean escape especially popular with couples.

            <h2>British Virgin Islands</h2>

            </figure>

            <p>"Posh" is the best word to describe the British Virgin Islands.

                The island country's beautiful coast sets it apart from other

                Caribbean destinations. The shoreline at Cane Garden Bay and the

                 white sand beaches on Anegada island are stunning. Meanwhile, the

                 boulders and sea pools at The Baths National Park (touted as one of

                 the most beautiful beaches in the world) mystify visitors. One of

                 the best ways to see these scenic islands is by yacht or on a boat

                 tour from the nearby U.S. Virgin Islands. Alternatively, you can

                 relax on a beach or by a pool at one of the upscale hotels.
