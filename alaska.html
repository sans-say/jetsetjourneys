        <P>Exploring the interior of Alaska will give you an entirely different

           perspective on this vast and rugged state. Take an Inside Passage cruise

           and gaze upward at the sky that is as blue as the lakes below. Hop on the

           Alaskan Railroad near Anchorage and see the spruce-lined, mountainous

           landscape whir by from a new perspective.
