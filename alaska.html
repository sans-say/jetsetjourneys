        <P>Exploring the interior of Alaska will give you an entirely different

           perspective on this vast and rugged state. Take an Inside Passage cruise

           and gaze upward at the sky that is as blue as the lakes below. Hop on the

           Alaskan Railroad near Anchorage and see the spruce-lined, mountainous

           landscape whir by from a new perspective.

        <p>In Alaska, ancient rivers of ice wind between mountains and grind out of

           valleys. Towering walls of ice like the Hubbard Glacier, Endicott Arm

           Dawes and the twin Sawyer Glaciers thunder as they calve <b><i>massive

           icebergs.</i></b> Some shore excursions allow up close interaction with

           these natural wonders.
