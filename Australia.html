<p>Sydney is one of the world’s great harbour cities and an essential
stop for any cruise to Australia. Whether arriving or departing, you’ll
cruise past the iconic Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge and
through the dramatic sandstone cliffs of The Heads at the entrance to the
Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>The city offers a spectacular blend of art, culture, dining, events,
outdoor activities and grand colonial architecture. Sydney is the ideal
destination to start or finish your cruise, and it’s compact enough to
explore on a day in port. It’s also the only Australian city to have two
dedicated cruise terminals – the Overseas Passenger Terminal and White Bay
Cruise Terminal.</p>
